Date: 2023-02-03

## Status

Accepted

Supercedes [3. Use Svelte for front-end components](0003-use-svelte-for-front-end-components.md)

## Context

Svelte has some nice features but library and community support are still a little rough around the edges.

## Decision

Use Next.JS for front-end components

## Consequences

Better library support, testing, tooling, etc.
