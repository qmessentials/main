# 5. Use main repo for docs and for main docker compose

Date: 2023-03-31

## Status

Accepted

See for context [6. Use separate repos in a single organization rather than a monorepo](0006-use-separate-repos-in-a-single-organization-rather-than-a-monorepo.md)

## Context

There wasn't anywhere in GitHub to put the main development docker compose file, or to put the documentation.

## Decision

Put all of that content into a main repo, separate from the code

## Consequences

This information is one one easy-to-find place
